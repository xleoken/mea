// This implementation is derived from the `oneshot` crate [1], with significant simplifications
// because this crate supports only asynchronous receive operations.
//
// [1] https://github.com/faern/oneshot/blob/83fd0864/src/lib.rs

//! A one-shot channel is used for sending a single message between asynchronous tasks. The
//! [`channel`] function is used to create a [`Sender`] and [`Receiver`] pair that form the channel.
//!
//! The sender is used by the producer to send the value. The receiver is used by the consumer
//! to receive the value.
//!
//! The sender and receiver can be used by separate tasks.
//!
//! Since [`Sender::send`] is not async, it can be used anywhere. This includes sending between
//! two runtimes, and using it from non-async code.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! # #[tokio::main]
//! # async fn main() {
//! use mea::oneshot;
//!
//! let (tx, rx) = oneshot::channel();
//!
//! tokio::spawn(async move {
//!     if let Err(_) = tx.send(3) {
//!         println!("the receiver dropped");
//!     }
//! });
//!
//! match rx.await {
//!     Ok(v) => println!("got = {:?}", v),
//!     Err(_) => println!("the sender dropped"),
//! }
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! If the sender is dropped without sending, the receiver will fail with [`RecvError`]:
//!
//! ```
//! # #[tokio::main]
//! # async fn main() {
//! use mea::oneshot;
//!
//! let (tx, rx) = oneshot::channel::<u32>();
//!
//! tokio::spawn(async move { drop(tx) });
//!
//! match rx.await {
//!     Ok(_) => panic!("This doesn't happen"),
//!     Err(_) => println!("the sender dropped"),
//! }
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! If the receiver is dropped before receiving, the sender will fail with [`SendError`]:
//!
//! ```
//! use mea::oneshot;
//!
//! let (tx, rx) = oneshot::channel::<u32>();
//!
//! drop(rx);
//!
//! match tx.send(42) {
//!     Ok(_) => panic!("This doesn't happen"),
//!     Err(_) => println!("the receiver dropped"),
//! }
//! ```

/// The atomic state publishes access to the `message` and `waker` slots. Initializing a slot does
/// not by itself transfer ownership; the corresponding release operation does, and an acquire
/// operation is required before the other endpoint accesses it.
///
/// * `EMPTY`: no message or waker is published. The sender may be initializing the message, and the
///   receiver may temporarily own a reclaimed waker, but neither slot is available to the other
///   endpoint.
/// * `RECEIVING`: the receiver has published an initialized waker. It may reclaim the waker by
///   returning to `EMPTY`, or the sender may move to `AWAKING` and take ownership of it. The sender
///   retains ownership of any message that it has not yet published.
/// * `AWAKING`: the sender exclusively owns the published waker and any unpublished message while
///   it publishes either a message or a disconnect. The receiver must not access either slot;
///   cancellation may only transfer allocation cleanup to the sender by moving to `DISCONNECTED`.
/// * `MESSAGE`: the sender has published an initialized message and no longer accesses the channel.
///   The receiver owns the message and the allocation.
/// * `DISCONNECTED`: no message can subsequently be received. The transition that reaches or
///   observes this state determines which endpoint owns any remaining message, waker, and
///   allocation cleanup.
///
/// The state is no longer meaningful after an operation obtains exclusive ownership of the whole
/// allocation, such as when `send` creates a `SendError`.
